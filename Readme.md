TubeTK: Tubular Object Extraction, Registration, and Analysis
=============================================================

[TubeTK](http://www.tubetk.org) is an open-source toolkit for the segmentation, registration, and analysis of tubes and surfaces in images, developed by [Kitware, Inc.](http://www.kitware.com)

Tubes and surfaces, as generalized 1D and 2D manifolds in N-dimensional images, are essential components in a variety of image analysis tasks. Instances of tubular structures in images include blood vessels in magnetic resonance angiograms and b-mode ultrasound images, wires in microscopy images of integrated circuits, roads in aerial photographs, and nerves in confocal microscopy.

A guiding premise of TubeTK is that by focusing on 1D and 2D manifolds we can devise methods that are insensitive to the modality, noise, contrast, and scale of the images being analyzed and to the arrangement and deformations of the objects in them. In particular, we propose that TubeTK's manifold methods offer improved performance for many applications, compared to methods involving the analysis of independent geometric measures (e.g., edges and corners) or requiring complete shape models.

TubeTK offers various interface layers:

* [TubeTK/tubetklib][TubeTK/tubetklib]: This is the algorithms library.   It is the lowest level of access to the methods of TubeTK.  It is only available via C++, and it requires considerable expertise to effectively combine and call its methods to do anything useful.   Interfacing directly with these algorithms is not recommended and is not well supported. Unit-level testing is performed continuously on these methods.

* [TubeTK/include][TubeTK/include]: This is the ITK interface to select methods in `TubeTK/tubetklib`.  This level of interface is intended for ITK users and Python scripts writers.  The methods exposed represent a level of modularization that invites experimentation, integration with other toolkits (e.g., Scikit-Learn), and development of processing pipelines that accomplish significant image analysis goals.  The interface is available as an ITK Extension and thereby available via Python using Wrapped ITK.

* [TubeTK/apps][TubeTK/apps]: These are the command-line interface (CLI) equivalents to the methods available via `TubeTK/include`.  This is intended for bash, bat, and other system-call scripts.  The level of modularization and intended users are similar to those of `TubeTK/include`.  C++ and python-based CLIs are provided.  Continuous, unit-level testing of `TubeTK/include` is provided via these applications.

Compiling ITKTubeTK's requirements
----------------------------------

Compling ITKTubeTK requires that you have CMake 3.11 or later.

There are two dependencies that must be compiled first

1) ITK
2) SlicerExecutionModel

For ITK, we want to compile ITK v5.0 or later.   Begin by checking out ITK's source

    $ cd /c                               (To keep paths short, start at a top-level dir)
    $ mkdir src
    $ cd src
    $ git clone https://github.com:/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK.git -b Release
    $ mkdir ITK-Release
    $ cmake-gui ..\ITK

Using CMake, you should configure ITK with the following options
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release           (This is an advanced option)
* ITK_LEGACY_SILENT = On               (This is an advanced option)
* ITK_WRAP_PYTHON = On                 (Note: Only Python3 is supported at this time)
* Module_MinimalPathExtraction = On    (This is an advanced option)

Once you have configured and generated your build files (e.g., for make or ninja or whatever):

    $ ninja  (or make, or nmake, or whatever is appropriate for your system)

This build process can take many hours on a Windows PC, because it is generating the files needed
to use ITK with Python, as well as the standard C++ libraries, applications, examples, and tests.

Then we repeat this build process for SlicerExecutionModel (used by ITKTubeTK applications):

    $ cd ~/src
    $ git clone https://github.com:/Slicer/SlicerExecutionModel.git
    $ mkdir SlicerExecutionModel-Release
    $ cd SlicerExecutionModel-Release
    $ cmake-gui ..\SlicerExecutionModel

Using CMake, you should configure SlicerExecutionModel as follows:
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release
* ITK_DIR = ~/src/ITK-Release

Once SlicerExecutionModel's cmake files are configured and build files are generated, you should
build the application:

    $ ninja  (or make, or nmake, or whatever is appropriate for your system)

This build should be relatively quick.  And now you are ready to compile ITKTubeTK

Compiling ITKTubeTK
-------------------

Once ITK and SlicerExecutionModel have been compiled as described above, you can compile ITKTubeTK:

    $ cd ~/src
    $ git clone https://github.com:/KitwareMedical/ITKTubeTK
    $ mkdir ITKTubeTK-Release
    $ cd ITKTubeTK-Release
    $ cmake-gui ..\ITKTubeTK

Then we configure the CMake variables for ITKTubeTK
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Release
* ITK_DIR = ~/src/ITK-Release
* TubeTK_BUILD_APPLICATIONS = On
* SlicerExecutionModel_DIR = ~/src/SlicerExecutionModel-Release
* TubeTK_WRAP_PYTHON = On

Then configure and generate you build files using cmake, and compile

    $ ninja

Now you will want to add ITKTubeTK's applications to your command-line PATH.  The directory to include
in that path is:

    ~/src/ITKTubeTK/bin

Using a Compiled and Python-Wrapped ITk and ITKTubeTK from Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------

First, to be able to run all the python tests and examples, the following packages are required:
* numpy
* scipy
* jupyter
* IPython
* tornado
* pyzmq
* jinja2
* tables
* matplotlib
* pyqtgraph
* PyOpengl
* PySide

Installing most required packages can be done with the following command line:

    $ pip install requirements.txt

Second, you will need to add the modules of python-wrapped ITK and ITKTubeTK to your python environment.
This is accomplished by copying the files that specify the paths to their python modules into your
python site-packages directory.

To find the site-packages directory on your system, follow the directions on this link:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/122327/how-do-i-find-the-location-of-my-python-site-packages-directory

Let's assume that path is /Python/Python36/site-packages.

First you will want to copy ITK's python paths file into that directory

    $ cp ~/src/ITK-Release/Wrapping/Generators/Python/WrapITK.pth /Python/Python36/site-packages

Then you will want to add ITKTubeTK's paths file ONTO that file

    $ cat ~/src/ITKTubeTK-Release/Wrapping/Generators/Python/WrapITK.pth >> /Python/Python36/site-packages/WrapITK.pth

Then you can test your configuration:

    $ python -c "import itk"

and

    $ python -c "from itk import TubeTK"

Both of the above commands should execute and return without errors.
